# twitter-reply-bot
This bot uses read-write privileges with twitter API and tweepy to stream tweets and auto-reply to matching phrases.

Create a twitter dev profile and then create a separate python file with API authorization keys, populate with keys, then import into your main file.  PHRASE_TO_SEARCH is where you can put anything from people's usernames to phrases/keywords for the API to catch in the stream.
